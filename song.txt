He was my North, my South, My East and West
My working week and my Sunday rest
My moon, my midnight, my Talk, my Song
I thought that love would last forever
But I was wrong

The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;
For nothing now can ever come to any good.
